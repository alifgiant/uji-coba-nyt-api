# NYT Simple App

## Description
I write this to qualify in recruitment process.
I wrote The app using MVI pattern. Which intent is written using Android ViewModel's LiveData

## Noteable Libraries
- **Anko Layout and Common**:
To help with UI, because i heard about the place i'm looking to join
trying to implement atomic design pattern. I have tried JetPack compose but since the maturity
of library is still low i canceled using that
- **Glide**:
To help with image loading and caching
- **Retrofit**:
To help networking
- **Kotlin Coroutine**:
To help networking and paraller processing

## Progress
I'm sure have done all the required task, except searching capability due to i'm almost run out of time 3 days.

The problem is because i took much time in trying out JetPack compose instead of Anko.
